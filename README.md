# Video Game Sales Analysis
Overview
This project entails a comprehensive sales analysis of video games spanning the period from 1980 to 2020. The analysis aims to explore trends in the video game market, identify top-selling platforms and genres, analyze regional sales patterns, and investigate correlations within the dataset.

# Analysis Highlights
Sales Trend: A decline in overall sales was observed post-2010, primarily due to a scarcity of available data.
Top Platforms: The Nintendo DS emerged as the platform with the highest number of games, while the PlayStation 2 (PS2) secured the top spot in terms of sales of games available on PS2.
Genre Distribution: Action games dominated the market with a substantial 20.1%, followed by sports games at 14.1%, among other genres.
Regional Sales Patterns: The analysis delves into regional sales patterns to understand variations in market preferences across different regions.
Top-Selling Games: Identification of top-selling games provides insights into popular titles driving sales during the analyzed period.
Correlation Exploration: The project explores correlations within the dataset to uncover relationships between various factors influencing game sales.
